You need to check the following:

### Browser compatibility

Currently Web uses the [Sensor API - Gyroscope],
but it is not compatible with some of the major browsers, such as Safari, Firefox.

For more information, see [Browser compatibility][Gyroscope browser compatibility].

### Secure contexts

You should consider using `HTTPS`,
browsers can only use sensors in secure contexts ([relevant limitations][Secure contexts relevant limitations]).

You can refer to [issue 22][] to enable it, or enable it yourself using other methods.
