You can use the following code:

```diff {4} showLineNumbers
...

Tilt(
+ lightShadowMode: LightShadowMode.projector,
  ...
),

...
```

For more information, see: [Tilt widget - LightShadowMode][].

You should assess the performance risks yourself.
If your scenario runs smoothly, then you can use it.

<Note type="warning" title="Performance risk exists">
Apply a shadow to the entire `Tilt` widget, similar to a projector effect.  
will display a shadow that exactly matches the non-transparent parts of the widget.  
Recommended for the following scenarios:

- Images only
- No data states
- No Hero tags
</Note>
